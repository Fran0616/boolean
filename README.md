# boolean
Overview
===========

Python supports the following logical operators. 

1. **and** - if both the operands are true, the condition is true
2. **or** - if any of the operands are true, the condition is true 
3. **not** - return false if the results is true, and return true if the results is false. 

Code Overview 
==============
x = 1
y = 0

z = **(( x == y) and  (x == y))** or not(x == y)

z = **(( x == y) and  (x == y))** or  not(x == y)

z = **(( false) and (false))** or (true)

z = **false** or true

z = true

Print(not(z))

z = false
